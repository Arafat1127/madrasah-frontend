                        <strong>Introduction:</strong> Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority country.
                        Alongside general education, madrasa education holds immense
                        importance in this country. For this reason, establishing madrasas
                        has always been essential to meet the needs of Islamic education.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Naming:</strong> In 1978, there was no madrasa in the main
                        town of Damurhuda Thana under Chuadanga district. Realizing the
                        importance of religious education, the local people initiated
                        discussions about establishing a madrasa. As a result, a religious
                        gathering was organized with participation from respected community
                        members. During this event, a respected Islamic scholar from Furfura
                        Sharif named the institution <strong>“Damurhuda Darussunnat (D.S)”</strong>, which
                        continues to be its official name.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Establishment:</strong> The madrasa was officially established on{" "}
                        <strong>January 1, 1978</strong>, with the active efforts and support of prominent
                        individuals of the area including <em>Maulana Md. Hurmat Ali</em>,{" "}
                        <em>Nazir Ahmed Biswas</em>, <em>Ali Ahmed Biswas</em>, <em>Abdul Khaleq</em>,{" "}
                        <em>Farae Malita</em>, <em>Abdur Rob</em>, and <em>Shamsul Alam Master</em>. Initially,
                        a temporary building was constructed using straw roofs and bamboo
                        mats. Later, students were enrolled, teachers were appointed,
                        classes were started, and an organizing committee was formed to
                        manage the institution’s activities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In <strong>1984</strong>, the madrasa received <strong>academic recognition from the
                            government</strong>, allowing it to open classes up to <strong>Dakhil (secondary)</strong>{" "}
                        level. The first full recognition was granted on{" "}
                        <strong>01/01/1984</strong>, beginning with class 9 and later extending to class
                        10. In <strong>1985</strong>, the madrasa received approval to hold Dakhil
                        examinations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The madrasa’s superintendent and assistant teachers have since
                        worked tirelessly to improve the quality of education and maintain
                        the smooth running of academic and administrative functions. In line
                        with the government’s vision of a Digital Bangladesh, the
                        institution now integrates digital content to provide modern and
                        effective education.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Growth and Recognition:</strong> On <strong>01/09/1985</strong>, the madrasa was
                        included under the <strong>Monthly Pay Order (MPO)</strong> scheme. Currently,
                        Damurhuda Upazila has <strong>11 madrasas</strong>, and in <strong>2004</strong>, this madrasa
                        was approved as a <strong>Dakhil and JDC (Junior Dakhil Certificate)
                            examination center</strong>. At present,{" "}
                        <strong>Damurhuda D.S. Dakhil Madrasa (Center Code: 510)</strong> serves as the
                        examination center for <strong>six madrasas</strong> in the upazila.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> As the madrasa is located in the upazila
                        headquarters, initiatives are underway to open <strong>Alim (Higher
                            Secondary)</strong> classes soon. We hope for the continued success and
                        development of this institution, and pray that it plays a leading
                        role in advancing modern and Islamic education in the region.
